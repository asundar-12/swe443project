Version 2.3 of our project (TRUST DAD REAL ESTATE AGENCY)

Final Group Project Submission Materials:

Purpose of each folder:

Property Listing Subsystem:

Demo = Property Listing MVC

DemoREST = PropertyListing REST Controller

Buyer Subsystem:

buyerMVC = Buyer MVC

buyerREST = Buyer REST Controller

Seller subsystem:

sellerMVC = Seller MVC

sellerREST = Seller REST Controller


Forgot to rename demo to property listings, didn't want to change it just in case it messed something up.

Kept a copy of each of our frontend files in the root directory of this repo for easy access, but included them in each of our MVCs too.
